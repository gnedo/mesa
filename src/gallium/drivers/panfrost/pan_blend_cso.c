/* A given Gallium blend state can be encoded to the hardware in numerous,
 * dramatically divergent ways due to the interactions of blending with
 * framebuffer formats. Conceptually, there are two modes:
 *
 * - Fixed-function blending (for suitable framebuffer formats, suitable blend
 *   state, and suitable blend constant)
 *
 * - Blend shaders (for everything else)
 *
 * A given Gallium blend configuration will compile to exactly one
 * fixed-function blend state, if it compiles to any, although the constant
 * will vary across runs as that is tracked outside of the Gallium CSO.
 *
 * However, that same blend configuration will compile to many different blend
 * shaders, depending on the framebuffer formats active. The rationale is that
 * blend shaders override not just fixed-function blending but also
 * fixed-function format conversion. As such, each blend shader must be
 * hardcoded to a particular framebuffer format to correctly pack/unpack it. As
 * a concrete example, to the hardware there is no difference (!) between RG16F
 * and RG16UI -- both are simply 4-byte-per-pixel chunks. Thus both formats
 * require a blend shader (even with blending is totally disabled!), required
 * to do conversion as necessary (if necessary).
 *
 * All of this state is encapsulated in the panfrost_blend_state struct
 * (our subclass of pipe_blend_state).
 */

/* Given an initialized CSO and a particular framebuffer format, grab a
 * blend shader, generating and compiling it if it doesn't exist
 * (lazy-loading in a way). This routine, when the cache hits, should
 * befast, suitable for calling every draw to avoid wacky dirty
 * tracking paths. If the cache hits, boom, done. */
