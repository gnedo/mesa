/* The compiler middle-end architecture: Explaining (non-)monolithic shaders
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Typically, there is one-to-one correspondence between API and HW shaders,
 * that is, for every API shader, there is exactly one shader binary in
 * the driver.
 *
 * The problem with that is that we also have to emulate some API states
 * (e.g. alpha-test, and many others) in shaders too. The two obvious ways
 * to deal with it are:
 * - each shader has multiple variants for each combination of emulated states,
 *   and the variants are compiled on demand, possibly relying on a shader
 *   cache for good performance
 * - patch shaders at the binary level
 *
 * This driver uses something completely different. The emulated states are
 * usually implemented at the beginning or end of shaders. Therefore, we can
 * split the shader into 3 parts:
 * - prolog part (shader code dependent on states)
 * - main part (the API shader)
 * - epilog part (shader code dependent on states)
 *
 * Each part is compiled as a separate shader and the final binaries are
 * concatenated. This type of shader is called non-monolithic, because it
 * consists of multiple independent binaries. Creating a new shader variant
 * is therefore only a concatenation of shader parts (binaries) and doesn't
 * involve any compilation. The main shader parts are the only parts that are
 * compiled when applications create shader objects. The prolog and epilog
 * parts are compiled on the first use and saved, so that their binaries can
 * be reused by many other shaders.
 *
 * One of the roles of the prolog part is to compute vertex buffer addresses
 * for vertex shaders. A few of the roles of the epilog part are color buffer
 * format conversions in pixel shaders that we have to do manually, and write
 * tessellation factors in tessellation control shaders. The prolog and epilog
 * have many other important responsibilities in various shader stages.
 * They don't just "emulate legacy stuff".
 *
 * Monolithic shaders are shaders where the parts are combined before LLVM
 * compilation, and the whole thing is compiled and optimized as one unit with
 * one binary on the output. The result is the same as the non-monolithic
 * shader, but the final code can be better, because LLVM can optimize across
 * all shader parts. Monolithic shaders aren't usually used except for these
 * special cases:
 *
 * 1) Some rarely-used states require modification of the main shader part
 *    itself, and in such cases, only the monolithic shader variant is
 *    compiled, and that's always done on the first use.
 *
 * 2) When we do cross-stage optimizations for separate shader objects and
 *    e.g. eliminate unused shader varyings, the resulting optimized shader
 *    variants are always compiled as monolithic shaders, and always
 *    asynchronously (i.e. not stalling ongoing rendering). We call them
 *    "optimized monolithic" shaders. The important property here is that
 *    the non-monolithic unoptimized shader variant is always available for use
 *    when the asynchronous compilation of the optimized shader is not done
 *    yet.
 *
 * Starting with GFX9 chips, some shader stages are merged, and the number of
 * shader parts per shader increased. The complete new list of shader parts is:
 * - 1st shader: prolog part
 * - 1st shader: main part
 * - 2nd shader: prolog part
 * - 2nd shader: main part
 * - 2nd shader: epilog part
 */

/* How linking shader inputs and outputs between vertex, tessellation, and
 * geometry shaders works.
 *
 * Inputs and outputs between shaders are stored in a buffer. This buffer
 * lives in LDS (typical case for tessellation), but it can also live
 * in memory (ESGS). Each input or output has a fixed location within a vertex.
 * The highest used input or output determines the stride between vertices.
 *
 * Since GS and tessellation are only possible in the OpenGL core profile,
 * only these semantics are valid for per-vertex data:
 *
 *   Name             Location
 *
 *   POSITION         0
 *   PSIZE            1
 *   CLIPDIST0..1     2..3
 *   CULLDIST0..1     (not implemented)
 *   GENERIC0..31     4..35
 *
 * For example, a shader only writing GENERIC0 has the output stride of 5.
 *
 * Only these semantics are valid for per-patch data:
 *
 *   Name             Location
 *
 *   TESSOUTER        0
 *   TESSINNER        1
 *   PATCH0..29       2..31
 *
 * That's how independent shaders agree on input and output locations.
 * The si_shader_io_get_unique_index function assigns the locations.
 *
 * For tessellation, other required information for calculating the input and
 * output addresses like the vertex stride, the patch stride, and the offsets
 * where per-vertex and per-patch data start, is passed to the shader via
 * user data SGPRs. The offsets and strides are calculated at draw time and
 * aren't available at compile time.
